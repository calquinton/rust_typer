# Rust Typer

# Overview

Rust Typer will eventually be a typing test that runs in the terminal. Future features include:

* Display a random quote.
* Display the author of the quote after you finish typing.
* Display your wpm (words per minute) when you finish typing.
* Display your accuracy in percentage when you finish typing.

In its current form, the program simply reads a csv file (quotes.csv) and differentiates between the two columns.

I wrote this software to learn the basics of rust. I hope to become more familiar with rust as I complete the software.
